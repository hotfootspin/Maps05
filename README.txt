This is my Maps project. I started it for a class in iOS programming. It is a compilation of
my collection of scenic maps. Each map has a geographic scene on the cover. These scenes are
geocoded. The maps can be accessed through a list titled geographic locations (cities,
states) or through MapKit pins keyed to the scenes (Glacier National Park, Liberty Bell).
